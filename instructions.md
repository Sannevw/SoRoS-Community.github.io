Here are my suggestions for developing the website. 

1. Every page is made using MarkDown language.
2. We have a default webpage [[Home]](index.html) to include all the relevent pages on the website.
3. Whenever a page is made, a link to [[Home]](index.html) should be put at the begining of the weboage.(See [[People]](people.html) page for example.
4. Suggestions and discussions could be initialized in issues.
5. Instructions of developing this website can be found here [[Instructions]](instructions.html)
6. This website now has `hacker` theme but we can change it later.
