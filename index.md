## Welcome to SoRoS Community

The SoRoS stands for Social Robotics Sweden. We are a community that consists students who are working on social robotics applications in Sweden. Currently, we are at the stage of designing the website structure. 

- Everybody is welcome to contribute to the development of the website.

Here are my suggestions for developing the website. Several individual pages should be added to in order to provide information on different categories.

### People
