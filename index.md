## Welcome to SoRoS Community

The SoRoS stands for Social Robotics Sweden. We are a community that consists students who are working on social robotics applications in Sweden. Currently, we are at the stage of designing the website structure. 

- Everybody is welcome to contribute to the development of the website.

Here are my suggestions for developing the website. 

1. Every page is made using MarkDown language.
2. We have a default webpage [[Home]](index.html) to include all the relevent pages on the website.
3. Whenever a page is made, a link to [[Home]](index.html) should be put at the begining of the weboage.(See [[People]](people.html) page for example.
4. Suggestions and discussions could be initialized in issues.
5. Instructions of developing this website can be found here [[Instructions](instructions.html)]

Currently, we have following pages:

### People

All the members can be found here on this [[People]](people.html) page.

### Research

Recent research papers published can be found on this [[Research]](research.html) page.

### Instructions

Instructions of contributing to the development of the webpage can be found on this [[Instructions]](instructions.html) page.
